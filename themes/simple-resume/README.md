# Simple Resume Theme
This theme is meant to create a web based, simple resume, that you can print.

## Features
 - Web based resume
 - Printable
 - Straightforward/simple design

## Install theme on your hugo site
```
hugo new site your-site-name # if you already have a site ignore this line and the next
cd your-site-name
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/tylerjlawson/simple-resume.git
``` 
Once you have done this, you may use the `exampleSite` folder as an example for how to set your project up. The two main things to pay attention to is to first set this in your `config.toml` file:
```toml
theme = "simple-resume"
```
Then you will need to replicate the data used in the `exampleSite/data/content.toml` file to fill in the fields for your resume.

## Print your Resume
You can print the page straight to a pdf or to paper if you wish. I have had best luck printing with the margins set to 'minimum', but you can set custom margins when printing if it looks off to you.
